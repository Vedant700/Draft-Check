            A volcano is an opening in a planet or moon’s crust through which molten rock, hot gases, and other
            materials erupt. Volcanoes often form a hill or mountain as layers of rock and ash build up from repeated
            eruptions.

            Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant, or extinct. Active volcanoes have a recent history of
            eruptions; they are likely to erupt again. Dormant volcanoes have not erupted for a very long time but may
            erupt at a future time. Extinct volcanoes are not expected to erupt in the future.

                <span style="color: var(--yellow);font-weight: 500;">Constructive Plate Boundaries</span>- At
                constructive plate boundaries, the tectonic plates are moving away from one another. The Earth’s
                crust is pulled apart to create a new pathway for rising hot magma to flow on to the surface. Volcanoes
                can sometimes form in these setting; one example is Iceland.

                <span style="color: var(--yellow);font-weight: 500;">Constructive boundaries-</span> Constructive
                boundaries are mainly
                located under the sea, e.g. the Mid Atlantic Ridge. Here, chains of
                underwater volcanoes have formed along the plate boundary. One of these volcanoes may become so large
                that it erupts out of the sea to create a volcanic island, e.g. Surtsey and the Westman Islands near
                Iceland.

                Iceland is about 18 to 25 million years old and is thus one of the youngest countries in the world. The
                formation of Iceland started about 60 million years ago when the mid-Atlantic ridge (the boundary
                between the North American tectonic plate and the Eurasian tectonic plate) started to give way and when
                mantle plumes appeared.

                    <span style="color: var(--yellow);font-weight: 500;">Destructive Plate Margin- </span> A destructive
                    plate margin usually involves an oceanic plate and a continental plate. The plates
                    move towards one another and this movement can cause earthquakes.As the plates collide, the oceanic
                    plate is forced beneath the continental plate. This is known as subduction. This happens because the
                    oceanic plate is denser (heavier) than the continental plate.

                    When the plate sinks into the mantle it melts to form magma. The pressure of the magma builds up
                    beneath the Earth's surface. The magma escapes through weaknesses in the rock and rises up through a
                    composite volcano. The volcanic eruptions are often violent, with lots of steam, gas and ash.

                    If two continental plates collide, neither can sink and so the land buckles upwards to form fold
                    mountains. This is called a collision margin. Earthquakes can occur at collision margins.

                    At a conservative plate margin, the plates move past each other or are side by side moving at
                    different speeds. As the plates move, friction occurs and plates become stuck. Pressure builds up
                    because the plates are still trying to move. When the pressure is released, it sends out huge
                    amounts of energy, causing an earthquake. The earthquakes at a conservative plate boundary can be
                    very destructive as they occur close to the Earth's surface. There are no volcanoes at a
                    conservative plate margin.

                        A cinder cone, also called a scoria cone, is a volcano composed of volcanic cinders
                        (scoria), or small, rough particles of hardened lava. When lava that is highly charged with
                        gas bubbles erupts from a vent under pressure, it tends to shoot straight up into the air.
                        This effect is called a fire fountain, and it can sometimes be hundreds of meters high.

                        Blobs of the frothy lava break apart, cool quickly, and fall relatively close to the vent.
                        Over time, a cone-shaped hill builds up around a circular crater.

                Composite volcanoes are steep-sided volcanoes composed of many layers of volcanic rocks, usually made
                from high-viscosity lava, ash and rock debris. These types of volcanoes are tall conical mountains
                composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the strata that give rise to the name.

                Composite volcanoes are made of cinders, ash, and lava. Cinders and ash pile on top of each other, lava
                flows on top of the ash, where it cools and hardens, and then the process repeats.

                Shield volcanoes are volcanoes shaped like a bowl or shield in the middle with long gentle slopes made
                by basaltic lava flows. These are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow a great
                distance from a vent.

                They generally do not explode catastrophically. Since low-viscosity magma is typically low in silica,
                shield volcanoes are more common in oceanic than continental settings. The Hawaiian volcanic chain is a
                series of shield cones, and they are common in Iceland, as well.

                Lava domes are formed when erupting lava is too thick to flow and makes a steep-sided mound as the lava
                piles up near the volcanic vent. They are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava.
                They are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption. Like a composite volcano,
                they can produce violent, explosive eruptions, but their lava generally does not flow far from the
                originating vent.

                <span style="color: var(--yellow); font-weight: 500;">The Jupiter’s moon Io is <br>volcanically
                    active</span> has been <br>known since 1979, when Voyager<br> 1
                imaging
                scientist
                Linda Morabito<br> discovered the first evidence of <br>active volcanism on a body <br> other than
                Earth. But it’s<br>
                far
                from alone. For instance,<br> while Mars’s volcanoes appear<br> to be either dormant or extinct,<br>
                evidence from
                the
                Venus Express <br> spacecraft suggests that many of <br> Venus’s volcanoes are active.

            <p class="fact-two">
                In 2015, scientists recorded <br> video of
                <span style="color: var(--yellow); font-weight: 500;">sharks happily <br> swimming</span> around
                in
                the acidic,<br> hot,
                ash- and
                gas-<br> filled waters near the <br>Kavachi underwater volcano in <br> the Solomon Islands, which<br>is
                a mere 66 feet
                below <br>the surface. This suggests<br> extremophiles may be even<br> more diverse than we thought.

            <p class="fact-three">
                <span style="color: var(--yellow); font-weight: 500;">The Ring of Fire</span> is a region <br> around
                much of the rim of<br> the Pacific Ocean where many<br>
                volcanic eruptions
                and earthquakes<br> occur. The Ring of Fire <br>is a horseshoe-shaped belt<br> about 40,000 km long
                and<br>
                up to about
                500 km<br> wide.

                <span style="color: var(--yellow); font-weight: 500;">The VEI quantifies</span> the strength <br>
                of volcanic eruptions by measuring <br>
                the volume of material spewed by a <br>
                volcano, including volcanic ash, <br>
                fragments of volcanic rock and <br>
                lava, fast-moving currents of gas <br>
                and tephra, and other debris. The <br>
                height and duration of the eruption <br>
                are also factored in. The scale <br>
                ranges from 1 to 8. <br>
